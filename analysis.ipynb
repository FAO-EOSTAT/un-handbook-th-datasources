    "\n",
    "Analysis Ready Data (CEOS-ARD) are satellite data that have been processed to meet the [ARD standards](https://ceos.org/ard/) defined by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). ARD data simplify and accelerate the analysis of Earth observation data by providing consistent and high-quality data that are standardized across different sensors and platforms. ARD images processing includes geometric corrections, radiometric corrections, and sometimes atmospheric corrections. Images are georeferenced, meaning they are accurately aligned with a coordinate system. Optical ARD images include cloud and shadow masking information. These masks indicate which pixels affected by clouds or cloud shadows. For optical sensors, CEOS-ARD images have to be converted to surface reflectance values, which represent the fraction of light that is reflected by the surface. This makes the data more comparable across different times and locations. For SAR images, CEOS-ARD specification require images to undergo Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC) and are provided in the GammaNought ($\\gamma_0$) backscatter values. This value which mitigates the variations from diverse observation geometries and is recommended for most land applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARD images are available from various satellite platforms, including Landsat, Sentinel, and commercial satellites. This provides a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions to suit different applications. They are organised as a collection of  files, where each pixel contains a single value for each spectral band for a given date. These collections are available in cloud services such as Brazil Data Cube, Digital Earth Africa, and Microsoft's Planetary Computer. In general, the timelines of the images of an ARD collection are different. Images still contain cloudy or missing pixels; bands for the images in the collection may have different resolutions. [Figure 1](#fig-ard-datacubes) shows an example of the Landsat ARD image collection. "

A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the Earth captured in a specific space and time.

All images intersecting the convex hull of the `roi` are selected. \n",
    "- `bands`: Optional parameter with the bands to be used. If missing, all bands from the collection are used.\n",
    "- `orbit`: Optional parameter required only for Sentinel-1 images (default = \"descending\").\n",

    "\n",
    "Sentinel-1 GRD products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the WGS84 Earth ellipsoid model. GRD images are subject for variations in the radar signal's intensity due to topographic effects, antenna pattern, range spreading loss, and other radiometric distortions. The most common types of distortions include foreshortening, layover and shadowing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foreshortening occurs when the radar signal strikes a steep terrain slope facing the radar, causing the slope to appear compressed in the image. Features like mountains can appear much steeper than they are, and their true heights can be difficult to interpret. Layover happens when the radar signal reaches the top of a tall feature (like a mountain or building) before it reaches the base. As a result, the top of the feature is displaced towards the radar and appears in front of its base. This results in a reversal of the order of features along the radar line-of-sight, making the image interpretation challenging. Shadowing occurs when a radar signal is obstructed by a tall object, casting a shadow on the area behind it that the radar cannot illuminate. The shadowed areas appear dark in SAR images, and no information is available from these regions, similar to optical shadows.\n",
    " \n",
    "Access to Sentinel-1 GRD images can be done either by MGRS tiles (`tiles`) or by region of interest (`roi`). We recommend using the MGRS tiling system for specifying the area of interest, since when these images are regularized, they will be re-projected into MGRS tiles. By default, only images in descending orbit are selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to create a data cube of S1 GRD images over a region in Mato Grosso Brazil that is an area of the Amazon forest that has been deforested. The resulting cube will not follow any specific projection and its coordinates will be stated as EPSG 4326 (latitude/longitude). Its geometry is derived from the SAR slant-range perspective; thus, it will appear included in relation to the Earth's longitude. "
